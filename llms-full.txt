## Frequently Asked Questions

### General
**Q: What is bentonite drilling?**
A: Bentonite drilling is a method that uses bentonite clay slurry to stabilize borehole walls during deep drilling. The slurry prevents collapse in unstable soils, allowing drilling of large-diameter holes (60–150cm) to depths of 30+ meters. It's the standard method for foundation piles, retaining walls, and deep drainage pits in Israel.

**Q: What areas do you serve?**
A: We serve all of Israel, with primary focus on the central region (Sharon, Netanya, Hod HaSharon, Herzliya, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, and greater Tel Aviv). We regularly work on projects across the country.

**Q: Are you a licensed contractor?**
A: Yes. We hold contractor license #36281 from the Israeli Registrar of Contractors. All our operators are certified and our equipment is insured and safety-compliant.

**Q: How do I get a quote?**
A: Call 052-9556123, email eliav1334@gmail.com, or fill out the contact form at https://eliavafar.co.il/contact. On-site assessments and quotes are free.

### Drilling
**Q: What's the difference between bentonite and polymer drilling?**
A: Bentonite uses natural clay slurry — heavier, better for very unstable soils. Polymer uses synthetic fluid — lighter, cleaner, faster biodegradation. Both stabilize boreholes. The choice depends on soil conditions, environmental requirements, and project specifications.

**Q: How deep can you drill?**
A: Typically up to 30+ meters, depending on soil conditions and project requirements. Drainage pits are usually 8–25 meters deep.

**Q: What diameter holes can you drill?**
A: From 60cm to 150cm diameter, depending on the application and structural requirements.

### Drainage Pits
**Q: How much does a drainage pit cost?**
A: Costs vary by depth, diameter, soil conditions, and location. See our pricing guide at https://eliavafar.co.il/blog/drainage-pits-pricing for 2026 estimates. Free on-site quotes available.

**Q: Do I need a permit for a drainage pit?**
A: In most Israeli municipalities, yes. We assist with the permitting process and can advise on local requirements.

**Q: How long does installation take?**
A: Typically 1–3 days for standard residential drainage pits, depending on depth and soil conditions.

### Equipment Rental
**Q: Can I rent equipment without an operator?**
A: No. All our equipment rental includes a certified, experienced operator. This ensures safety, proper equipment use, and optimal results.

**Q: Who pays for fuel?**
A: Fuel is included in the rental price. The customer is not responsible for fuel costs.
